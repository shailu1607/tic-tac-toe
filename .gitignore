Tic-Tac-Toe players using inheritance implementation based on MinMax Algorithm in AI

MIN - MAX ALGORITHM
=> Min-max algorithm is a recursive or backtracking algorithm which is used in decision-making and game theory. 
   It provides an optimal move for the player assuming that opponent is also playing optimally.
=> Min-Max algorithm uses recursion to search through the game-tree.
=> Min-Max algorithm is mostly used for game playing in AI. Such as Chess, Checkers, tic-tac-toe, 
   go, and various tow-players game. This Algorithm computes the minimax decision for the current state.
=> In this algorithm two players play the game, one is called MAX and other is called MIN.
=> Both the players fight it as the opponent player gets the minimum benefit while they get the maximum benefit.
=> Both Players of the game are opponent of each other, where MAX will select the maximized value 
   and MIN will select the minimized value.
=> The minimax algorithm performs a depth-first search algorithm for the exploration of the complete game tree.
=> The minimax algorithm proceeds all the way down to the terminal node of the tree, then backtrack 
   the tree as the recursion.

EXPLANATION
To create a genuine Tic-Tac-Toe AI (Artificial Intelligence) that plays a flawless game, let's integrate everything 
we've learned so far about minimax and evaluation functions. 
This AI will take into account every scenario and decide on the best course of action.
